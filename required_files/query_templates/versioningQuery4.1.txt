#  Query Name : query4.1
#  Query Type: 4, Historical single-version structured query
#  Query Description : 
#  Retrieve the 10 most recent creative works, that are about or mention different topics of a specific past version. 

#  Query Answering Choke Points : 
#    - join ordering based on cardinality of functional property cwork:dateCreated
#      Optimizer should use an efficient cost evaluation method for choosing the optimal join tree
#    - OPTIONAL clauses (treated by query optimizer as nested sub-queries)
#      Optimizer should decide to put optional triples on top of the join tree 
#      (i.e. delay their execution to the last possible moment) because OPTIONALs are treated as a left join
#    - Reasoning: rdfs:subClassOf, rdf:type
